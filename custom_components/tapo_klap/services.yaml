set_speed:
  # If the service accepts entity IDs, target allows the user to specify entities by
  # entity, device, or area. If `target` is specified, `entity_id` should not be
  # defined in the `fields` map. By default it shows only targets matching entities
  # from the same domain as the service, but if further customization is required,
  # target supports the entity, device, and area selectors
  # (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/). Entity selector
  # parameters will automatically be applied to device and area, and device selector
  # parameters will automatically be applied to area.

    entity:
      domain: fan
      # If not all entities from the service's domain support a service, entities
      # can be further filtered by the `supported_features` state attribute. An
      # entity will only be possible to select if it supports at least one of the
      # listed supported features.

        - fan.FanEntityFeature.SET_SPEED
        # If a service requires more than one supported feature, the item should
        # be given as a list of required supported features. For example, if the
        # service requires both SET_SPEED and OSCILLATE it would be expressed like this
        - - fan.FanEntityFeature.SET_SPEED
          - fan.FanEntityFeature.OSCILLATE
